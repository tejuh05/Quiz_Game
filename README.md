## DESCRIPTION:- This quiz game is designed to make learning fun and interactive by incorporating engaging riddles and brain teasers. Through the development process, I've learned the importance of randomized questions and answer options to keep players thinking critically rather than memorizing responses. Implementing features like score tracking and timers has also highlighted how gamification can enhance time management skills and self-assessment. Its applications range from educational tools for classrooms to brain-training exercises that boost problem-solving abilities. Additionally, it serves as an entertaining way to pass time while fostering knowledge retention and quick thinking. Overall, this project has reinforced how a well-designed quiz can be both an enjoyable experience and a valuable learning resource.
